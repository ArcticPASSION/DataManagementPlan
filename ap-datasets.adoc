|Unprocessed data (temperature of air, snow, ice and seawater) are also made available in near-real time at meereisportal.de

The data set will contain data from multiple buoys deployed at different locations in different years.  Data from individual buoys will be published as soon as they are processed, i.e at different times depending on their deployment date and duration of drift in sea ice.

|pan-Arctic coastal meltwater discharge 
a| Daily MAR 5.5 km resolution runoff (both ice and tundra) is statistically downscaled (using adaptive local vertical runoff gradients) to 250 m.

The downscaled runoff is integrated for every surface drainage basin (obtained using surface DEMs and hydrological routing tools) in the Arctic (i.e. ice covered regions of the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Russian Arctic)

Outflow points of these drainage basins at the coastlines (and the basins themselves) are provided.

The basin specific daily downscaled runoff data is stored in a relational database and can be obtained by using the basin/outflow ID.

|Upwelling and downwelling visible radiation measurements of the autonomous ice-tethered OptiCAL 'pp' buoy (LT-ITO) deployed on drifting sea ice in the "North Pole sea ice station" during Arctic Ocean 2022 cruise. 
a| Optical Chain And Logger (OptiCAL) systems capture PAR-like data at 12 logarithmically-spaced levels down to 50 m depth, and, along with positional data, transmit these data hourly via Iridium. 
The PAR sensors have a wide dynamic range, able to detect PAR from 5x10⁻⁵ µMol s⁻¹ m⁻² to 100 µMol s⁻¹ m⁻² and thereby graph a wide range of light behaviour from winter to summer and from surface to depth. 
Sampling at the 12 levels is accomplished by resin-containment 'nodes' located along a power and communication cable that hangs vertically from the underside of the surface spar-buoy. 
The nodes are at nominal depths of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 21, 32, and 50m. Each node has six 'PAR' sensors, three detecting downwelling light and three upwelling light. 
Two of each set of three sensor sets have simple optical filters: one transmitting 'orange' the other 'blue'. 
The third sensor, being unfiltered, is 'white'. PAR data are archived in CSV files as 'counts' from the sensors, and are in units of millihertz (mHz).

Two ice-tethered observatories (named “pp“ and “qq”) measuring sub - sea-ice Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) were deployed within the Arctic Ocean 2022 cruise.

|To convert from mHz to the expected SI unit of µmol s-1 m-2 requires a conversion function. 

This work is (as of May 2023) still in preparation, but will be published as "Development and calibration of a high dynamic range and autonomous ocean-light instrument (OptiCAL) to measure sub-surface profiles in ice-covered waters": Bernhard Schartmüller1, Phil Anderson, David McKee, Stacey Connan-McGinty, Tomasz Piotr Kopec, Malin Daase, Geir Johnsen and Jørgen Berge.

The LT-ITO “pp“ was deployed on 2022-07-31, and recorded data hourly to 2022-10-19.

Some data has been received for publication and are integrated in the catalogue.

|Data from downward looking Acoustic zooplankton and fish profiler (AZFP) deployed on drifting sea ice in the "North Pole sea ice station" during Arctic Ocean 2022 cruise. 
a| Bioacoustic data from an Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler (AZFP) deployed in Central Arctic Ocean. 
Raw data from the four AZFP frequencies (38, 125, 200 and 455kHz) are published. 
This echosounder was deployed on 2022-07-30, data were downloaded retrieved on 2023-01-18, after 193 days of operation.

The AZFP was connected to the surface buoy with a 5 m long umbilical cable and acoustic beam of the echosounder was pointed downward.


An independent GPS tracker of the type XEOS Rover was attached to the AZFP and its GPS track is also part of this data set.

|The ITO is still drifting and collecting data. Last known position (as for 2023-05-11) is 59.9724, -48.6922.

For the AZFP data, the initial and final deployment (.DPL) and configuration (.XML) files are included. these describe the instrument configuration and sampling plan. 
The bioacoustics data sets (.01A,.01B, ..., .02A,...) are consecutive, divided hourly. 
The first two digits describe the phase of the sampling program being used when the file was created while the letter B and C are for files generated within a same hour when the process is interrupted, for example, when backing up the data from the echosounder. 
The file names contain the date and time of each file.

Some data is received, details to be checked.

|Temperature and heating induced temperature difference measurements from the sea ice mass balance buoy SIMBA 02-02 deployed on drifting sea ice in the "North Pole sea ice station" during Arctic Ocean 2022 cruise.  
a| Sea ice mass balance buoy measures snow and sea ice thickness (ice growth and loss). The SIMBA-ITO is equipped with a thermistor string about 5 meter long (240 temperature sensors placed at 2cm intervals: thermistors 0 to 239). The instrument is estimating snow and ice thickness by measuring thermal conductivity of the media (the sensor chain is heated daily, and temperature changes are measured after 30 and 120 seconds from heating the sensor chain).

This ITO is also equipped with one in-air temperature sensor, deployed ~1m above the surface (thermistor 240).

In addition a GPS track is a supplementary part of this data set.

The ITO was sending data till late September 2022. After that data packets were arriving only occasionally until February 1st 2023.  Analysis of the diagnostic messages revealed that the underlying problem was in the data transmission (probably due to icing / overshadowing of the antenna).

After around two weeks of operation temperature measurements stopped coming. Status messages and positioning data were still being received.

Analysis of diagnostic messages indicated that the sensor chain was physically damaged.

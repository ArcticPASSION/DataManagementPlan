|EEA PM10 timeseries (in situ measurements) 
|https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/map/fme/AirQualityExport.htm 
|EEA 
|Downloaded dataset - local copy of remote dataset 
|EEA and FMI PM10 data obtained from monitoring stations (for Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland) are used with CAMS PM10 analysis and forecast data as input for our Neural Network model which provides PM10 forecast. CAMS PM10 wildfires only forecast and CAMS Wildfire flux of total particulate matter data are planned to be shown on our PS platform and provided daily to INFRA service.

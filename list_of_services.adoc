| ARCTIC_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHYS_002_001_a (TOPAZ4)
|The operational TOPAZ4 Arctic Ocean system uses the HYCOM model and a 100-member EnKF assimilation scheme. It is run daily to provide 10 days of forecast (average of 10 members) of the 3D physical ocean, including sea ice; data assimilation is performed weekly to provide 7 days of analysis (ensemble average).

== Data summary

The  purpose of the data management plan is to document how the data generated by the project Arctic PASSION are handled during and after the project. It describes the basic principles for data management within the project. This includes standards for documentation  at discovery and data levels as well as  data sharing and preservation including life cycle management of datasets. 

This document is a living document that will be updated during the project. Arctic PASSION is following the principles outlined by the Open Research Data Pilot and The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (Wilkinson et al. 2016).

// What is the purpose of the data collection/generation and its relation to the objectives of the project? 
The Arctic PASSION project is described in more detail in the project website which is available at https://arcticpassion.eu/. The purpose of Arctic PASSION is creation and implementation of a coherent, integrated Arctic observing system. This implies integrating already existing observing systems in a systems of systems approach as well addressing gaps in the current observing system. Arctic PASSION will generate data through the project implementation, but equally important is to map and establish access to already existing datasets in support of the pilot services and other activities of Arctic PASSION. 

// What types and formats of data will the project generate/collect? 
Arctic PASSION will promote the use of self-explaining file formats (e.g. NetCDF, HDF/HDF5, DwCA) combined with semantic and structural standards like the Climate and Forecast Convention for data documentation. The default format for Arctic PASSION datasets  in the geoscientific domain is NetCDF following the Climate and Forecast Convention (feature types grid, timeseries, profiles and trajectories if applicable). For data in the biological domain Darwin Core Archive is promoted. If none of these formats are suitable other formats can be used, but a detailed product manual following a template has to be prepared to ensure proper reuse of the data in the future.

// Will you re-use any existing data and how? 
Arctic PASSION will exploit existing data in the region. In particular operational meteorological data made available through WMO Global Telecommunication System (GTS) will be important for the model experiments. No full overview of third party data that will be used is currently available. An overview of the third party data to be used will be provided. Essentially this will at least, but limited to, include data from the World Meteorological Organisation, Copernicus services in Europe, data already generated by project partners and data found harvesting discovery metadata from relevant data centres. 

If deemed necessary (required by the scientific community in Arctic PASSION) metadata describing relevant third-party observations will be harvested and ingested in the data management system and through this simplifying the data discovery process for Arctic PASSION scientists. If specifically needed by one of the pilot services of Arctic PASSION, data may also be cached to ensure interoperable data that can be used by the web based services of the pilot servicesfootnote:[This could be necessary to establish an Arctic Window of Copernicus or when data are available through third party data centres but not in standardised and interoeprable form.].

// What is the origin of the data? 
Arctic PASSION will rely on both data generated by projhect partners during the duration of the project, legacy data and observing systems of the partners and third party data available through data centres not part of Arctic PASSION.

An overview of the data generated by the project will be made available in <<Datasets>>, more specifically in <<dataset-table>>. This list serves as a reminder for datasets. Eventually all datasets should be discoverable through the Arctic PASSION data catalogue.

// What is the expected size of the data? 
There is currently no estimate for the expected volume of the data. Such volume estimates only make sense for the data actively managed by Arctic PASSION. These estimates will be generated when a better overview of the exact datasets is available. However it is expected that it will be in the order to several Terabytes. 

// To whom might it be useful ('data utility')?
Arctic PASSION aims to _bring the Arctic data into action_. Thus data can be relevant for many communities. Internally the primary purpose of the data is to serve the needs of the project's pilot services. 

== FAIR data

=== Making data findable, including provisions for metadata
Arctic PASSION will set up a data portal with both human and machine interfaces. Human and machine interfaces will rely on a data catalogue that is generated using an information mode that is in use for multiple projects and activties. This is the https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/metno/mmd/blob/master/doc/mmd-specification.html[MET Norway Metadata Format Specification (MMD)]. This is developed to be compliant with GCMD DIF and ISO19115 and is widely used for mapping harvested metadata into a unified data model. Mappings to DCAT is in progress. 

NOTE: To be further elaborated on relations to e.g. NetCDF-CF and Attribute Conventions for dataset discovery (i.e. making discovery metadata embedded with actual data). 

IMPORTANT: Sensitive data generated by community based monitoring will be handled in a separate system and only aggregated information will be made available in the data catalogue. However, this data Management Plan will also be developed to cover the sensitive data. 

=== Making data openly accessible
data will be served from the host data centre wherever possible. Datasets that are needed by a pilot service, but is not openly available although the data license allows open access, will be cached during the project duration and made available for potential users internally and externally.

NOTE: To be further elaborated.

=== Making data interoperable 
Arctic PASSION will rely on standardised file formats for data encoding. these standardised formats also have semantic frameworks for annotation of the data. The specific standards that will be promoted by Arctic PASSION includes:

CF-NetCDF:: NetCDF adhering to the http://cfconventions.org/index.html[Climate and Forecast Conventions] is widely used, both in the oceanographic community, in the Earth System Grid Federation, in Copernicus services, by ESA and EUMETSAT for Sentinel data provision and WMO is developing WMO specific profiles of the standard. By adding the https://adc.met.no/node/4[Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery], discovery level metadata can be embedded in the datasets.  
Darwin Core Archive:: To be elaborated.

Data that doesn't fit into these categories will be accompanied by a detailed product manual allowing machine interpretation of the data. 

IMPORTANT: The template for the product manual is to be developed.

=== Making data reuseable
A very important requirement for reuseable data is that data are released using a clear data license. Arctic PASSION will promote the usage of the https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International] license.

NOTE: To be further elaborated.

== Allocation of resources
Arctic PASSION Work Package 2, Bringing the Arctic Data System to action, has allocated resources for cataloguing, serving and preserving data within the project period. Handling of sensitive data from Community Based Monitoring is done in Work Package 4. Overall responsibility for the Data Management Plan lies with Work Package 2. 

== Data security
Most of the data generated by Arctic PASSION is open. Arctic PASSION is working to establish secure connections between data centres and data consumers to ensure that correct decisions can be made using data. However, data from third parties will also be made available, for these data there is limited room for Arctic PASSION to ensure integrity and security of data.

Data from Community Based Monitoring that could be of sensitive nature will not be public available, only aggregated non sensitive information will be available through the Arctic PASSION data catalogue.

NOTE: To be further elaborated focusing on data integrity and communication between data centre and data consumer.

== Ethical aspects
As mentioned above, sensitive information from Community Based Monitoring is handled in a separate system adhering to the ethical and legal regulations for such data. There could be other information that has constraints from ethical reasons (e.g. species information or breeding areas).

IMPORTANT: Data within Arctic PASSION will be handled according to the principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary".

NOTE: To be further elaborated.

== Other issues
None known yet.

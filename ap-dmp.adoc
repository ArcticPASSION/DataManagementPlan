== Data summary

The purpose of the data management plan is to document how the data generated by the project is handled during and after the project. It describes the basic principles for data management within the project. This includes standards and generation of discovery and use metadata, data sharing and preservation and life cycle management. 

This document is a living document that will be updated during the project. Arctic PASSION is following the principles outlined by the Open Research Data Pilot and The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (Wilkinson et al. 2016).

// What is the purpose of the data collection/generation and its relation to the objectives of the project? 
FIXME

// What types and formats of data will the project generate/collect? 
Self-explaining file formats (e.g. NetCDF, HDF/HDF5) combined with semantic and structural standards like the Climate and Forecast Convention will be used. The default format for Arctic PASSION datasets are NetCDF following the Climate and Forecast Convention (feature types grid, timeseries, profiles and trajectories if applicable). 

Arctic PASSION will exploit existing data in the region. In particular operational meteorological data made available through WMO Gobal Telecommunication System will be important for the model experiments. No full overview of third party data that will be used is currently available, but since the start of the project SYNOP data from WMO GTS have been available to the Arctic PASSION community. Work is in proigress for more data from GTS. If necessary (required by the scientific community in Arctic PASSION) metadata describing relevant third-party observations will be harvested and ingested in the data management system and through this simplifying the data discovery process for Arctic PASSION scientists. There is however no plan initially to harvest the data. 
FIXME

// Will you re-use any existing data and how? 
FIXME

// What is the origin of the data? 
FIXME

// What is the expected size of the data? 
FIXME

// To whom might it be useful ('data utility')?
FIXME

A full overview of the data generated by the project is available as a preliminary list in the appendix and the final datasets will be available through the data portal.FIXME
